This repository has been archived and should no longer be used.

If you're building a Polymer component or Polymer application, you should use
[d2l-localize-behavior](https://github.com/BrightspaceUI/localize-behavior) instead.

If you simply need access to the [d2l-intl library](https://github.com/Brightspace/intl), use it directly.
